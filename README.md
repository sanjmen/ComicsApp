## Basic setup

Before you start you should:

* Create a [keystore.properties](keystore.properties) file ```cp keystore.properties.sample keystore.properties```
* Get your API key pair from your [Marvel Developer Account](https://developer.marvel.com/) and change in keystore.properties file

```
MARVEL_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
MARVEL_SECRET_KEY = "your_secret"
```

* To to generate a signed APK you must create a key and a keystore. [How to generate a keystore](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key)
* then update keystore.properties with your own key and store credentials 

````
STORE_PASSWORD="my store password"
KEY_PASSWORD="my key password"
KEY_ALIAS="my key alias"
STORE_FILE="/path/to/my/store/file"
````

* now you can build and install the application

## Build and Install

```
$ ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

This creates an APK named app-release.apk in project_name/app/build/outputs/apk/.
This APK file is signed with the private key specified in your build.gradle file and aligned with zipalign.

Also you can build, align, sign, and install the release APK on an emulator or device all with the installRelease task.
 
```
$ ./gradlew installRelease
```
